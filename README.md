Awesome python magic!

This was done in Python 3.2.3 and it uses the library: Pygame.

Here are some numbers that are fantastic to use when you run the program:

Distance between walls: 2

m1 mass: 1

m1 location: 0.2

m1 velocity: 15

m2 mass: 1.5

m2 location: 0.5

m2 velocity: 3

m3 mass: 2

m3 location: 0.9

m3 velocity: -10

Feel free to experiment with your own numbers. 
Just remember when entering initial positions: 
m1 MUST be the leftmost particle, 
m2 MUST be the middle particle, 
and m3 MUST be the rightmost particle.

If the simulation gets stuck OR if you would like to watch the animation in slower time:
decrease the number on lines 75 and 76 of the code.

If the simulation is mind-numbingly slow, increase the number on lines 75 and 76 of the code.

Due to sloppy coding, frame rates during the simulation will vary from computer to computer, but this will not affect the accuracy of the scientific results.
