===================

This was one of my first python projects, and the code isn't great since I was just starting out.

This was done in Python 3.2.3 and it uses the library: Pygame.

Here are some numbers that give a satisfying result to use when you run the program:

Distance between walls: 2

m1 mass: 1

m1 location: 0.2

m1 velocity: 15

m2 mass: 1.5

m2 location: 0.5

m2 velocity: 3

m3 mass: 2

m3 location: 0.9

m3 velocity: -10

Feel free to experiment with your own numbers. 

If you would like to watch the animation in slower time:
decrease the number on lines 75 and 76 of the code.

If the simulation is slow, increase the number on lines 75 and 76 of the code.
